# My Thought Process

## Solidity Version

#### Findings

- Use a specific solidity version

```js
pragma solidity ^0.7.6;
```

- Looking at main entry point

I navigate to **Solidity Metrics**, and scroll down to **Contract Summary**, expand the tab and start with the `PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle` function

## PuppyRaffle:enterRaffle

- `PuppyRaffle:entranceFee` should be `i_entranceFee` to show that it is immutable based off the variable name.

- There's a possible denial of service when checking for duplicates `LINE:97` if the `players` array grows.

<summary>Code</summary>

```js
function testEnterRaffleDos() public {
    vm.deal(address(this), 4 ether);
    address[] memory players = new address[](1);
    uint256 gasUsed;
    uint256 prevGas = gasleft();
    players[0] = playerOne;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
    gasUsed = prevGas - gasleft();

    players[0] = playerTwo;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
    assertLt(gasUsed, prevGas - gasleft());

    gasUsed = prevGas - gasleft();

    players[0] = playerThree;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
    assertLt(gasUsed, prevGas - gasleft());

    gasUsed = prevGas - gasleft();

    players[0] = playerFour;
    puppyRaffle.enterRaffle{value: entranceFee}(players);
    assertLt(gasUsed, prevGas - gasleft());
    }
```

Let's document our discovery in our `findings.md` file.

## PuppyRaffle:refund function

Going through this function, we spot a juicy **Reentrancy Attack**.

**Prevention**

1. **Performing a Check-Effect-Interactions (C.E.I) model**

- Check: can be a require statement or conditional
- Effect: running your contract code
- Interaction: how our contract calls external contracts

2. **Locks on Functions**

```c
bool locked = false;

function withdrawBal() public {
    uint256 bal = userBalance[msg.sender];
    require(!locked, "Wait for current call to end");

    locked = true;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: bal}("");

    require(success, "Something went wrong: Could not send ETH");
    locked = false;
}
```

## PuppyRaffle:selectWinner function

### weak RNG

On **LINE** [ 158 ], the use of predictable values can be exploited by a malicious miner, can lead to a less random outcome which defeats the purpose as stated in the docs.

### Ditch magic numbers

Refactor code in `PuppyRaffle:selectWinner` **LINE** [ 166 - 167 ]

```diff
-   uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * 80) / 100;
-   uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * 20) / 100;

+   uint256 prizePoolPercentage = 80;
+   uint256 feePercentage = 20;
+   uint256 prizePool = (totalAmountCollected * prizePoolPercentage) / 100;
+   uint256 fee = (totalAmountCollected * feePercentage) / 100;
```

### Unsafe casting can lead to Overflow

**LINE** [ 168 ] in presents an overflow issue which certainly occurs once `PuppyRaffle` contract balance exceeds `18 ether`

### Inability to select winner if winner is a Smart Contract with a missing payable fallback function

**LINE** [ 187 ] presents an exploit for a malicious attacker to prevent distribution of rewards by using a Smart contract missing a payable fallback function to be a player that gets selected to receive rewards.

## PuppyRaffle:\_isActivePlayer

### Findings

This function is not used anywhere within the contract.

### Impact

Waste of gas and redundant clutter in codebase.

## Informationals

### Better naming conventions

- `entranceFee` is immutable, variable can be renamed to `i_entranceFee` for easier identification when reading through codebase.

- `raffleDuration` does not get changed throughout the lifecycle of smart contract hence, can be marked as **immutable**. It's also gas efficient.
